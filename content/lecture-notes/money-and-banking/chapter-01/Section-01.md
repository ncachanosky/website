When most people hear the word “money,” they immediately picture paper bills, coins, or perhaps even the balance on a bank app. But in economics, money is not defined by what it looks like — it is defined by what it does. This distinction is important because money can take many forms across different times and cultures, and yet serve the same essential economic purposes.

This chapter explores what money is, how it functions in modern economies, how we use it to make payments, and how it has evolved throughout history. We will also reflect on where money might be heading in the future.

Let's start with the **definition** of money. Any good that can be widely used to purchase goods and services is considered money.

<div class="doc-definition">
Money is an asset that is <b>generally accepted</b> as a means of exchange (as payment for goods and services)
</div>

Money, therefore, is different from payment technologies (how payments take place), income (flow of earnings over time), and wealth (assets minus liabilities). Money is one type of asset among many.

It is important to **distinguish** between the definition of money and its functions.

## Understanding Money through its Functions

Economists tend to avoid narrow or overly simplistic definitions of money. Instead of saying “money is coins and bills,” we ask: What role does money play in an economy? In doing so, we come to understand money through its **functions** — the specific purposes it serves in facilitating economic life.

There are three primary functions of money:
1. it acts as a medium of exchange,
2. as a unit of account,
3. and as a store of value. 
   
Let’s explore each of these in turn.

### Money as a Medium of Exchange

This is perhaps the most intuitive and historically significant function of money. In a barter economy, transactions are difficult because they require a “double coincidence of wants.” That is, if you are a baker and want a pair of shoes, you must find a shoemaker who not only needs bread but is also willing to trade shoes for it. These transactions are inefficient and time-consuming.

Money solves this problem by serving as a universally accepted medium through which goods and services are exchanged. It enables us to sell to one person and use the proceeds to buy from someone else. For example, a carpenter can sell a table to a customer and later use that money to buy groceries, even if the grocer doesn’t need a table. In this way, money allows for transactions between strangers, across time, and across space.

Because of this, money plays a crucial role in enabling complex economic systems. It allows for specialization and trade, and it reduces the time and effort required to make transactions.

### Money as a Unit of Account

The second function of money is to provide a standard measure of value. Without a common unit of account, it would be difficult to compare prices or assess the relative worth of different goods and services. Imagine a marketplace where each vendor accepts different items in barter: one wants wheat, another wants cloth, another wants goats. Comparing prices would be chaotic.

Money provides a common denominator. Saying that a car is worth $20,000 or a meal costs $15 gives us a way to easily compare values. It also simplifies accounting and financial planning, both for households and for firms.

### Money as a Store of Value

The third function of money is to preserve value over time. In order for money to be used for future purchases, it must retain its purchasing power. People are willing to accept money today because they trust that it will still be valuable tomorrow.

That said, money is not the only asset that stores value. Stocks, real estate, art, and even precious metals can serve this purpose. But money is unique in that it is the most liquid of all assets — meaning it is the easiest and quickest to use for transactions without losing value.

Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be converted into money. For example, selling a house or a painting may take weeks or months, and prices may fluctuate. By contrast, a $20 bill can be spent immediately and will be accepted virtually anywhere. Economists also distinguish between market liquidity (how easily an asset can be sold) and funding liquidity (how easily someone can borrow money).
