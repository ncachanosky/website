Money is not just a tool of exchange; it is a social institution that supports nearly every aspect of modern life. Understanding money means understanding trust, incentives, and the way economic relationships are structured over time and across space.

In this chapter, we explored what money is, the functions it performs, the various ways we use it, and how it has evolved from salt and gold to mobile apps and digital ledgers. In future chapters, we will examine how money is created, how banks and central banks interact with it, and the complex challenges of managing modern monetary systems.
