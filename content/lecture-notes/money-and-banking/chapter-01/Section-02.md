## How We Use Money

Now that we understand what money is and what it does, let’s turn to the ways in which we use it. Over time, payment methods have evolved from simple exchanges of physical cash to complex digital systems. These **payment technologies** play an important role in shaping how quickly and securely transactions can be made.

### Paying with Cash

Cash is the most straightforward method of payment — it involves the direct transfer of money from one person to another. Historically, this included not just coins and banknotes, but also items like salt, cattle, or shells that functioned as **commodity money**. These items had value even outside their role as money.

In contrast, **fiat money** — like the U.S. dollar or the euro — has no non-monetary use. It is valuable only because people believe it is, and because governments have declared it legal tender. This means it must be accepted for the settlement of debts and taxes, though it can still be rejected in spot transactions between private parties.

Today, we are also seeing the rise of **digital money**, which similarly has no intrinsic value, but exists entirely in electronic form and is used via digital devices and platforms.

### Using Checks

Checks are not money themselves but act as instructions to a bank to transfer money from one account to another. While their use is declining in many parts of the world, checks offer some advantages: they are more secure than carrying large amounts of cash, they allow for payment tracking, and they make it easier to manage large or delayed payments.

### Electronic Payments

Modern payment systems now rely heavily on electronic technologies. Debit cards, credit cards, and online bank transfers allow us to move money without physical contact. Credit cards are particularly interesting because they do not involve immediate payment by the buyer — instead, the credit card issuer pays the seller, and the buyer repays the issuer later.

Electronic payments also include automated clearinghouse (ACH) transfers, used for regular payments like salaries and utility bills. These are essentially digital checks that are processed in batches.

In recent years, we’ve seen a wave of **new mobile and app-based payment platforms**. Services like PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Zelle allow users to send money with just a few taps. In some parts of the world, mobile phones themselves have become the primary banking tool. For example, M-Pesa in Kenya enables millions of users to manage finances, pay bills, and make purchases — even in rural areas where traditional banks are absent.
